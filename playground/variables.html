    //THIS IS FROM VIDEO 4

    //strict is enforced by default mostly if you're using modules
    //don't need to declare this becuase you are properly declaring
    // 'use strict';

    //3 kinds of variables
    //var const and let - different ways to declare these
    //the semi colons are used to terminate a js line (statement end)

    // //VAR and LET can have their value changed/updated
    //SCOPE: VAR variables are function scoped variables (only available inside the parent function)
    //SCOPE: let and const are block scoped (available within their containing curly braces/code block)
    var first = 'Wen';
    let age = 300;

    // //CONST contsant variables cannot be changed/updated
    const cool = true;
    console.log(first);

    // //you can assign but not declare using the var, let or const (like ed below here).  
    // //If you declare the use strict in the head of the script tag, this will no longer work (reference error: dog is not defined)
    // //bad practice!
    dog = 'Ed';
    //variables are named lower case - can have $ or _ in the name
    //$ is a jquery library convention so dont use it
    //_ synonymous with low dash helper library

    //use camel case if multiple words
    //classes are the only instance where you should start name with capital
    //UpperCamelCase
    //camelCaseUseThisAlways
    //underscores_in_your_name_is_called_snake_case
    //kebab-case-is-not-allowed-in-js
